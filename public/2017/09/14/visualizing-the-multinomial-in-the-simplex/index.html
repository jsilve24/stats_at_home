  <p>Lately I have been working on figures for a manuscript. In this process I created a few visualizations that I thought might help others visualize the Multinomial distribution. I will focus on describing how counting processes introduce uncertainty into estimates of relative abundances and I will end with a discussion of how understanding the Multinomial has impacted my view of analyses of sequence count data (e.g., data from 16s studies of the microbiome, RNA-seq, and more). Here I have chosen to focus on the Multinomial distribution, however, much of what I discuss also relates to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution#Multivariate_hypergeometric_distribution">Multivariate Hypergeometric Distribution</a> as well.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution">Multinomial distribution</a> is a very important distribution that provides a good model for many real world counting processes. Think about drawing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> balls from an urn of infinite size containing <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> different colors of balls. Due to our assumption of the infinite size of the urn, we don’t worry about the total number of balls of each color in the urn, we simply work with the relative abundances <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p} = (p_1, \dots, p_D)\)</span> of each color of ball. We describe such relative abundances as elements of a “simplex” (basically just s <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> dimensional triangle) such that all elements <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> are positive and <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i p_i = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>When dealing with such count data, it is often of interest to estimate the proportions/relative abundances in the population being sampled. Let a random draw of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> balls be denoted by the vector of counts <span class="math inline">\((x_1, \dots, x_D)\)</span> in which the element <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> denotes the number of balls of color <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> drawn. The maximum likelihood estimates for the proportions of each color ball in the urn (i.e., the ML estimates for the Multinomial parameters) are given by <span class="math display">\[\hat{\mathbf{p}} = \left(\frac{x_1}{\sum_ix_i}, \dots, \frac{x_D}{\sum_ix_i}\right).\]</span> In other words, the maximum likelihood estimates are simply the relative abundance of each type of ball in our sample. Below I provide a function for visualizing the Multinomial distribution in terms of these maximum likelihood estimates <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mathbf{p}}\)</span>.</p>
<div id="a-function-to-aid-in-plotting" class="section level1">
<h1>A Function To Aid in Plotting</h1>
<p>First I am going to write a function to help visualize the Multinomial in terms of its parameter support.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(driver) # https://github.com/jsilve24/driver
library(combinat)
library(ggtern)

# n - number of samples
# p - vector of probabilities (length = 3)
plot_ternary_multinomial_density &lt;- function(n, prob){
  sx = t(xsimplex(p=3,n=n))
  dx = apply(sx, 1, function(x) dmultinom(x, size=n, prob=prob))

<div id="building-some-intuition-for-the-multinomial-distribution" class="section level1">
<h1>Building Some Intuition for the Multinomial Distribution</h1>
<p>Next I am going to point out a few features of the Multinomial distribution. I will depict the three types of things we are counting (they could be different colors of balls) as v1, v2, and v3.</p>
<div id="a-discritization-of-the-simplex" class="section level2">
<h2>A Discritization of the Simplex</h2>
<p>The Multinomial has a continuous parameter space, that is the vector <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> contains elements that are continuous and not discrete. However, Multinomial counting processes results in a discretization continuous parameter space.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>prob &lt;- miniclo(c(.37, .37, .3))
plot_ternary_multinomial_density(10, prob) +
  geom_point(data=setNames(as.data.frame(prob), c(&quot;v1&quot;, &quot;v2&quot;, &quot;v3&quot;)), color=&quot;red&quot;, size=2, fill=&quot;red&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-09-14-visualizing-the-multinomial-in-the-simplex_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Given a finite sample (e.g., non-infinite <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) we can only obtain a finite set of possible parameter values. If this does not make sense yet think about flipping a coin twice, there are 4 possible outcomes <span class="math inline">\(\{(H,H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T)\}\)</span> leading to 3 possible estimates for the underlying proportions <span class="math inline">\(\{(1, 0), (.5, .5), (0, 1)\}\)</span>. In this coin flipping example we cannot get a maximum likelihood estimate of <span class="math inline">\((0.3, 0.7)\)</span>. In the above visualization I have highlighted the true proportion that this Multinomial distribution is based on in red; note that with a sample of size 10 there is no way to perfectly estimate this “true” proportion. This discretization of the proportions is important to take into account when estimating proportions from count data as it introduces uncertainty into the resulting estimates.</p>
</div>
<div id="effect-of-changing-n-counting-as-a-random-process" class="section level2">
<h2>Effect of changing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (counting as a random process)</h2>
<p>Uncertainty in the Multinomial parameters is not simply due to the discretization of the parameter space. Uncertainty in these estimates also arises because we are modeling counting as a random process. Note that as we draw more and more balls out of the urn the Multinomial distribution concentrates around the true value. This is because drawing more balls is like having more replicates in an experiment, eventually (in the absence of bias) our estimates will start concentrating around the true value.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_ternary_multinomial_density(100, prob) +
  geom_point(data=setNames(as.data.frame(prob), c(&quot;v1&quot;, &quot;v2&quot;, &quot;v3&quot;)), color=&quot;red&quot;, size=2, fill=&quot;red&quot;)</code></pre>

<div id="effect-of-changing-mathbfp-focus-on-boundaries" class="section level1">
<h1>Effect of changing <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}\)</span> (focus on boundaries)</h1>
<p>Based on the above figures, it may seem simple to estimate proportions from count data, just collect at least 100 or so counts and you have a pretty good covering over the simplex. But this is often not the case in real world problems! In reality we are often confronted with situations in which some of the relative abundances are very small compared to some others (e.g., one color of balls is much more rare than another color). In addition, the difference between a zero proportion and a non-zero but small proportion is often very important (think about the difference between estimating that one type of ball is completely absent from an urn versus estimating that it is present but at much lower proportion than the other types of balls). In this situation it can become quite difficult to obtain enough samples to accurately estimate a non-zero proportion for the rare type of ball.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>prob &lt;- miniclo(c(.9, .091, .005))
p1 &lt;- plot_ternary_multinomial_density(100, prob) +
  geom_point(data=setNames(as.data.frame(prob), c(&quot;v1&quot;, &quot;v2&quot;, &quot;v3&quot;)), color=&quot;red&quot;, size=2, fill=&quot;red&quot;)

# Lets also zoom in on this region
p2 &lt;- p1 + theme_zoom_L(0.2)

# Now put these two plots side-by-side
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-09-14-visualizing-the-multinomial-in-the-simplex_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In the above figure we see that with only 100 counts, the majority of the distribution centers on estimating the component v3 with a relative abundance of zero even though the true simulated value is small but non-zero.</p>
</div>
<div id="implications-for-real-world-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Implications for Real World Data</h1>
<p>I would like to point out that this behavior of the Multinomial distribution results from a “statistical competition to be counted” between the components. We are only sampling <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> balls total, therefore having more of one type of ball will result in us measuring fewer counts from other types of balls. This does not mean that there is actually any interaction between the balls, simply that the way we are measuring the composition of the urn induces a correlation between the types of balls.</p>
<p>I have been seeing a lot of papers recently that seem to ignore this feature of their data generation process. For example, with next-generation sequencing technologies a large amount of DNA processed and only a small amount of that DNA is ever actually counted during sequencing. As a result of this there is the same type of “competition to be counted”, more of one type of DNA transcript will lead to fewer counts from other transcripts. Despite this, many analyses ignore this and draw inferences regarding the behavior of individual transcripts (e.g., differential abundance analyses). This does not make any sense to me. <strong>Also please note that I would welcome comments from readers who disagree with my opinion!</strong></p>
<p>That said, simply transforming counts to relative abundances by dividing the counts by the total (e.g., the Maximum Likelihood estimate for the Multinomial) as is commonly done with sequence count data does not make much sense to me either. The counting process does not allow us to measure relative abundances directly. As I pointed out above, the discretization of the underlying simplex and the uncertainty introduced by the random nature of counting are also essential components to account for, especially in the presence of very uneven relative abundances (e.g., when some transcripts/balls are very low abundance compared to others).</p>
