      <description>Lately I have been working on figures for a manuscript. In this process I created a few visualizations that I thought might help others visualize the Multinomial distribution. I will focus on describing how counting processes introduce uncertainty into estimates of relative abundances and I will end with a discussion of how understanding the Multinomial has impacted my view of analyses of sequence count data (e.g., data from 16s studies of the microbiome, RNA-seq, and more).</description>

      <description>The Idea First things first, Gauss is our dog.
Since I am able to work from home, my dog Gauss and I spend a lot of time together. As a result, I like to think I know why he does what he does. But of course I will never really know - though, it’s nice to think that I do. Both of us being a creatures of habit, we have fallen into a nice routine during the day - one where he sleeps the day away and comes to get me around 4pm for some outdoor training/playing.</description>

      <description>Motivation My Solution - Hybrid K-Means/Linear-Regression with Transformation Starting on Boring Simulated Data Now a more interesting simulated dataset More realistic, presense of observational noise Conclusions and future directions   Motivation I am a fan of the Stack Exchange forums. In particular, I like Cross Validated and Stack Overflow. An interesting question regarding clustering was posted recently. Essentially someone had the following dataset.
plot(Retirees) Essentially the poster wanted a way of clustering the observations into the “lines” that are fairly easy to observe in the data.</description>

      <description>The Basic Model The First Step - Multinomial Focusing on our Question - Binomial Approximating the Binomial - Poisson  When is the Poisson approximation to the Binomial valid? Looking at Real Parameters Values Calculating the distribution of quantities in light of uncertainty in lab measurements Bivariate Distributions    Droplet-based microfluidics are emerging as a useful technology in various fields of biomedicine. Both droplet digital PCR and droplet based culture methods require that droplets are created with either a single DNA molecule or a single cell per droplet.</description>

      <title>Fitting Non-Linear Growth Curves in R</title>

      <description>A few months ago I offered to help a friend fit a bunch of microbial growth curves using R. When I was looking over possible solutions I was quite supprised by how little information was available online. Apart from the R package grofit (which after playing around with I decided seemed a little over-designed for my uses) I found very limited recources or code available. As a result of this I wanted to share a few functions I wrote to quickly fit non-linear growth models.</description>
