      <description>Introduction I have been thinking a lot about the concept of Total Variance recently. Total variance (which can be defined as the trace of a covariance matrix) is a measure of global dispersion that has been particularly useful for me when building multivariate models. However, for some reason, I have yet to see this concept discussed much outside of compositional data analysis (see pg. 35 of Lecture Notes on Compositional Data Analysis) or Principle Component Analysis.</description>
