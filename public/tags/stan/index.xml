      <description>Framing the decision space Examples: Part 1  The other information that helps us make a decision Examples: Part 2  The Loss Function Examples: Part 3  Uncertainty Fully Worked Example: What price should I sell my used phone for? Next steps   Bayesian Decision Theory is a wonderfully useful tool that provides a formalism for decision making under uncertainty. It is used in a diverse range of applications including but definitely not limited to finance for guiding investment strategies or in engineering for designing control systems.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have been thinking a lot about the concept of Total Variance recently. Total variance (which can be defined as the trace of a covariance matrix) is a measure of global dispersion that has been particularly useful for me when building multivariate models. However, for some reason, I have yet to see this concept discussed much outside of compositional data analysis (see pg. 35 of Lecture Notes on Compositional Data Analysis) or Principle Component Analysis.</description>
