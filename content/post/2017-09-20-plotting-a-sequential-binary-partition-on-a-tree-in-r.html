<p>For users of PhILR (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/21887">Paper</a>, <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/philr.html">R Package</a>), and also for users of the ILR transform that wan to make use of the awesome plotting functions in R. I wanted to share a function for plotting a sequential binary partition on a tree using the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggtree.html">ggtree package</a>. I recently wrote this for a manuscript but figured it might be of more general use to others as well.</p>
<p>In its simplest form a sequential binary partition can be represented as a binary tree.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggtree(tr)+
  geom_label2(aes(label = label))</code></pre>

<p>However, as in the case of the ILR (or PhILR) transforms, we may have specific orientation information distinguishing between the top/bottom or left/right descendant of an internal node. In this case a sequential binary partition can be represented in sign matrix form in which 1 represents an “up” (or, for PhILR, a tip in the numerator of a balance), a -1 represents a “down” (or a tip something in the denominator), and a 0 represents a tip not downstream of that partition (or a tip not part of that balance). I will generate a sequential binary partition by using the function <em>phylo2sbp</em> in the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/philr.html"><em>philr</em> R package</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(V &lt;- phylo2sbp(tr))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6 n7
## t1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0
## t8 -1  1  1  1  0  0  0
## t6 -1  1  1 -1  0  0  0
## t7 -1  1 -1  0  1  0  0
## t2 -1  1 -1  0 -1  0  0
## t4 -1 -1  0  0  0  1  0
## t5 -1 -1  0  0  0 -1  1
## t3 -1 -1  0  0  0 -1 -1</code></pre>
<p>Here is a simple function that will augment the labels from a ggtree object with the information in the sign-matrix. The only reason this is semi-non-trivial is that ggtree has its own internal mechanisms for orienting branches by default. This function takes a ggtree object (which if not specified it will also create) and correctly labels the internal nodes in accordance with the ggtree object.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># - Assumes tree&#39;s internal nodes and tips are named
# - can pass smaller contrast matrix to subset which are annotated
# - A prebuilt ggtree object with corresponding tip/node names can be passed as
#     argument p
# - Currently designs for trees in vertical layout (see example below)
annotate_sbp &lt;- function(tr, V, p=NULL){
  sep &lt;- &quot;\n&quot; 
  if (!setequal(tr$tip.label, rownames(V))) stop(&quot;mismatch between tip.label of tree and rownames of V&quot;)
  if (!setequal(tr$node.label, colnames(V))) stop(&quot;mismatch between node.label of tree and colnames of V&quot;)
  if (is.null(p)) {
    p &lt;- ggtree(tr)
    need.annotation &lt;- TRUE
  }
  d &lt;- p$data
  n.tip &lt;- ape::Ntip(tr)
  n.node &lt;- ape::Nnode(tr)
  n.numbers &lt;- (n.tip+1):(n.node+n.tip)
  children &lt;- phangorn::Children(tr, n.numbers)
  children &lt;- lapply(children, function(x) x[order(c(d[x,&quot;y&quot;]),decreasing=TRUE)])
  names(children) &lt;- tr$node.label
  V.sign &lt;- sign(V)
  tips &lt;- phangorn::Descendants(tr, 1:nrow(d), type=&quot;tips&quot;)
  tips &lt;- lapply(tips, function(x) tr$tip.label[x])

  l &lt;- list()
  for (n in names(children)){
    signs &lt;- sapply(children[[n]], function(x) unique(sign(V[tips[[x]], n])))
    signs &lt;- ifelse(signs==1, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;)
    l[[n]] &lt;- paste(signs[1], n, signs[2], sep=sep)
  }
  l &lt;- unlist(l)
  d.order &lt;- d$label[d$label %in% names(l)]
  d$label[d$label %in% names(l)] &lt;- l[d.order]
  p$data &lt;- d
  p + geom_label2(aes(label=label))
}</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example of the output</p>
<pre class="r"><code>annotate_sbp(tr, V)</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully this is a pretty self-explanatory graphic. The (+) and (-) denote which of the two sub-trees contains the +1’s and -1’s in the sign-matrix form. In the language of PhILR/ILR the (+) points to the tips in the numerator of the balance and the (-) points to the denominator of the balance. If people like this function and if I have time to make it integrate more seamlessly with different tree geometries (e.g., radial fan layouts) I will add it to the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/philr.html"><em>philr</em> R package</a>.</p>
